# Configuration

Configuration is split between environment variables (`.env` file), Django models (managed via interactive
onboarding or the admin panel), and hardcoded defaults in `linkedin/conf.py`.

## LLM Configuration

LLM settings are stored on the `SiteConfig` DB singleton (editable via the admin panel, or prompted
during interactive onboarding if missing). There are two independent configurations — a
higher-end model for messaging/chat and a cheaper/faster model for everything else — each can use
a different provider.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
| `CHAT_LLM_PROVIDER` | Provider for the follow-up messaging agent (openai/anthropic/google/groq/mistral/cohere/openai_compatible). | `openai` |
| `CHAT_LLM_API_KEY` | API key for the chat provider. | (required) |
| `CHAT_AI_MODEL` | Model identifier used for follow-up message generation. | (required) |
| `CHAT_LLM_API_BASE` | Base URL, only used when `CHAT_LLM_PROVIDER=openai_compatible`. | (none) |
| `TASK_LLM_PROVIDER` | Provider for qualification, search-keyword generation, and fact extraction. | `openai` |
| `TASK_LLM_API_KEY` | API key for the task provider. | (required) |
| `TASK_AI_MODEL` | Model identifier used for qualification, keyword generation, and fact extraction. | (required) |
| `TASK_LLM_API_BASE` | Base URL, only used when `TASK_LLM_PROVIDER=openai_compatible`. | (none) |

## Campaign Settings (Django Model)

Campaign data is stored in the `Campaign` Django model (with `name` and `users` M2M), managed via
the admin panel (`/admin/`) or created during interactive onboarding.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| `product_docs` | text | Product/service description. Used by LLM qualification, follow-up agent, and search keyword generation. |
| `campaign_objective` | text | Campaign goal. Used by LLM qualification, follow-up agent, and search keyword generation. |
| `booking_link` | string | URL included in follow-up messages when suggesting a meeting. |
| `is_freemium` | boolean | Whether this is a freemium campaign (uses KitQualifier instead of BayesianQualifier). |
| `action_fraction` | float | Target fraction of total connections for freemium campaigns. |

## Account Settings (Django Model)

Account data is stored in the `LinkedInProfile` Django model (1:1 with `auth.User`), managed via
the admin panel or created during interactive onboarding.

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
|:------|:-----|:------------|:--------|
| `linkedin_username` | string | LinkedIn login email. | (required) |
| `linkedin_password` | string | LinkedIn password. | (required) |
| `active` | boolean | Enable/disable this account. | `true` |
| `subscribe_newsletter` | boolean | Receive OpenOutreach updates. | `true` |
| `connect_daily_limit` | integer | Max connection requests per day. | `20` |
| `connect_weekly_limit` | integer | Max connection requests per week. | `100` |
| `follow_up_daily_limit` | integer | Max follow-up messages per day. | `30` |
| `legal_accepted` | boolean | Whether the user accepted the legal notice. | `false` |

Rate limiting is enforced by `LinkedInProfile` methods (`can_execute()`, `record_action()`,
`mark_exhausted()`) backed by the `ActionLog` model, surviving daemon restarts.

### GDPR Location Detection

On the first run, the daemon checks the logged-in user's LinkedIn country code against a static set of
ISO-2 codes for jurisdictions with opt-in email marketing laws (EU/EEA, UK, Switzerland, Canada, Brazil,
Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand).

- **Non-GDPR location**: `subscribe_newsletter` is auto-set to `true` for that account.
- **GDPR-protected location**: the existing value is preserved (no override).
- **Unknown/empty location**: defaults to GDPR-protected (errs on the side of caution).

This check runs once per account (a database marker record prevents re-runs).

## Hardcoded Defaults (`conf.py:CAMPAIGN_CONFIG`)

Timing and ML defaults are hardcoded in `linkedin/conf.py`. These are not user-configurable.

| Key | Value | Description |
|:----|:------|:------------|
| `check_pending_recheck_after_hours` | `24` | Base interval (hours) before first pending check. Doubles per profile via exponential backoff. |
| `enrich_min_delay_seconds` | `6` | Min pause (seconds) between enrichment API calls during auto-discovery. |
| `enrich_max_delay_seconds` | `10` | Max pause (seconds) — actual delay is `random.uniform(min, max)`. |
| `enrich_max_per_page` | `10` | Max profiles enriched per discovered page (DOM order, LinkedIn relevance). |
| `burst_min_seconds` | `2700` | Min work burst (45 min) before the daemon takes a human-rhythm break. |
| `burst_max_seconds` | `3900` | Max work burst (65 min). Actual burst is `random.uniform(min, max)`. |
| `break_min_seconds` | `600` | Min break length (10 min) after each burst. |
| `break_max_seconds` | `1200` | Max break length (20 min). |
| `min_action_interval` | `120` | Minimum seconds between major actions. |
| `qualification_n_mc_samples` | `100` | Monte Carlo samples for BALD computation. |
| `min_ready_to_connect_prob` | `0.9` | GP probability threshold for promoting QUALIFIED to READY_TO_CONNECT. |
| `min_positive_pool_prob` | `0.20` | P(f > 0.5) threshold for positive pool check in exploit mode. |
| `embedding_model` | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` | FastEmbed model for 384-dim profile embeddings. |
| `connect_delay_seconds` | `10` | Delay between connect tasks. |
| `connect_no_candidate_delay_seconds` | `300` | Delay when candidate pool is empty. |
| `check_pending_jitter_factor` | `0.2` | Multiplicative jitter factor for backoff. |

Other constants: `MIN_DELAY` (5s) / `MAX_DELAY` (8s) for human-like wait timing.
